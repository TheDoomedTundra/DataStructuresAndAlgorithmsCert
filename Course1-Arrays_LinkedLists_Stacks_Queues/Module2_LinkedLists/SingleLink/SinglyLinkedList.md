# LinkedLists
* Alternatives to arrays that overcome some of their drawbacks
* Also implements the list ADT
* Unlike the array list which uses contiguous memory, LinkedLists use nodes that can be stored anywhere
    * Because of this, it never needs to be resized

Every LinkedList Needs:
* A pointer to the head node
